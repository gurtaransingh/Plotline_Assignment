# Invoicing System - Full Stack Development Internship


## Project Overview

Welcome to the Invoicing System project, part of my Full Stack Development Internship. This project aims to revolutionize how businesses manage their invoicing, payments, and financial transactions efficiently. I have developed a robust Node.js server coupled with an intuitive user interface to create a seamless billing experience.

## Problem Statement

In today's fast-paced business world, managing invoices is a critical task. To address this challenge, I have built a comprehensive Invoicing System that includes:

- A Node.js server exposing features via REST APIs.
- An intuitive user interface for users to interact with the billing system.

## Context

- Our company offers a wide range of products and services, each with its pricing structure.
- Users can create accounts, manage their carts, and view the total bill during checkout.
- Tax calculations follow these rules:
  - Tax PA: 12% of the product price for items priced between 1000 and 5000.
  - Tax PB: 18% for products priced above 5000.
  - Tax PC: A flat tax of 200 for all products.
  - Tax SA: 10% of the service price for services priced between 1000 and 8000.
  - Tax SB: 15% for services priced above 8000.
  - Tax SC: A flat tax of 100 for all services.
- Tax is applied individually to each item, ensuring accuracy.

## Functionalities

- **Product and Service Listings:** Users can view all product and service information, including prices.
- **Cart Management:** Users can add/remove products or services from their carts.
- **Cart Clearing:** Users have the option to clear the entire cart.
- **Billing Information:** Users can view their total bill, including item prices, quantities, and individual taxes, as well as the total value of selected items.
- **Order Placement:** Users can place orders with ease.
- **User Accounts:** A user account creation feature would enhance user experience.
- **Order History:** Users can view all orders they have placed.
